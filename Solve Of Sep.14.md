To solve each of the given expressions, we need to perform the indicated operations and then express the result in the specified base.

1. (11000011)2 + (11110101)2 = (X)2
To find X, we perform the binary addition as follows:

```
  11000011
+ 11110101
  ________
 100010000
```

Therefore, X is equal to 100010000 in binary.

2. (10111110)2 + (10000111)2 = (X)8
To find X, we perform the binary addition and then convert the result to octal:

```
   10111110
+  10000111
   ________
  110111001
```

Converting 110111001 from binary to octal gives us X = 671 in octal.

3. (01101110)2 + (11110000)2 = (X)16
To find X, we perform the binary addition and then convert the result to hexadecimal:

```
   01101110
+  11110000
   ________
  101111110
```

Converting 101111110 from binary to hexadecimal gives us X = 1BE in hexadecimal.

4. (326)8 + (77)8 = (X)8
To find X, we perform the octal addition:

```
   326
+   077
   ____
    403
```

Therefore, X is equal to 403 in octal.

5. (A9)16 + (BF)16 = (X)16
To find X, we perform the hexadecimal addition:

```
   A9
+  BF
  ____
  168
```

Therefore, X is equal to 168 in hexadecimal.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance.
